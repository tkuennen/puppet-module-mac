# The following variables describe your keyboard and can have the same
# values as the XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions options
# in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

XKBMODEL="apple"
XKBLAYOUT="<%= layout %>"
XKBVARIANT="mac"
XKBOPTIONS="lv3:ralt_switch,compose:rwin,altwin:swap_lalt_lwin,ctrl:swapcaps"

# If you don't want to use the XKB layout on the console, you can
# specify an alternative keymap.  Make sure it will be accessible
# before /usr is mounted.
